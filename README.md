# Factors Controlling Housing Prices in Large American Cities

Explosive growth in housing prices has pushed housing out of reach for many. But why, exactly, have housing prices risen so rapidly and to such high levels? How is a building that was sold for $200,000 in 1990 now selling for $1,000,000 or more? 

Narratives proliferate around housing prices, an issue that affects every single person in America and with which we all have significant, direct experience. Housing is expensive because there's not enough of it — development has been throttled by restrictive zoning laws. Some argue that prices are skyrocketing because of investment money, as funds and wealthy individuals snap up units as investments, not as personal dwellings. Others point to inflationary factors in the cost of building materials and labor — a decrease in immigration and domestric skilled trades training has resulted in a labor shortage. Greed is discussed — housing is pricy because it's a scarce commodity and landlords and builders can charge what they want. Many point to the low cost of borrowing achieved by monetary policy that forced interest rates towards zero and which allowed lenders to offer sub-3% mortgages. Others say housing prices have become untethered from physical factors, and that we are in a financial bubble. 

This analysis aims to deconvolve the factors driving housing by looking at correlations between housing prices, interest rates, stock markets, population, labor, and other relevant factors.
